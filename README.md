A mid-2000s promotional DVD for the high definition home theatre experience, by Disney and Monster. No clue where I got it.

This software was sitting on a CD I received while attending a summer camp for claymation.
I was super young, and I think it was held at a local university program, ran by student volunteers.
The software seems to want '.cax' files, so I'm going to keep on the lookout in case I find whatever I made there.
I felt a duty to archive it when I came across it, maybe just to preserve this memory.
