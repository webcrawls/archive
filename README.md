This software was sitting on a CD I received while attending a summer camp for claymation.
I was super young, and I think it was held at a local university program, ran by student volunteers.
The software seems to want '.cax' files, so I'm going to keep on the lookout in case I find whatever I made there.
I felt a duty to archive it when I came across it, maybe just to preserve this memory.

## Notes

- Most image scans you'll find on my archive.org page were taken using a Canon Pixma MX522 scanner+printer combo.
  It doesn't take the highest quality images, nor the cleanest, but I'm mostly happy with how the scans are coming out =)
- My 'publication dates' aren't super rigorous - I found them typically by listing the latest date present on the CD/DVD filesystem. If an "official" publication date was somewhere in the disc's files, I used that instead.
